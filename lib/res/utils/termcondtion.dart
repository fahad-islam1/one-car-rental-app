One Car Rental does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.


11.  Payment
11.1. You understand that use of the Services will result in Charges. After you have received Driver Services through your use of the Services, you are required to pay the Third–Party Driver Companies, represented by the Driver, the charges you were quoted when you sent the relevant booking request. One Car Rental may facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third–Party Driver Company through the Platform. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third–Party Driver Company. Charges will be inclusive of VAT where applicable. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable.

11.2. One Car Rental will quote you the Charges, without taking into account any discounts that you may be able to avail of by way of using any Voucher, before making a booking request. The value of the Voucher with the earliest expiry date that you have registered in the Platform before the trip starts will be automatically deducted from the Charges to calculate the amount payable (only to the extent that its value doesn’t exceed the Charge for the trip). The Charge in respect of any trip is payable when the trip commences and is due immediately at the end of a trip.

11.3. You may elect to cancel your request for Driver Services (i) at any time prior to acceptance of the trip being confirmed through the App and (ii) within five minutes of your approval of a booking request being accepted by the relevant Third-Party Driver Company (a “Confirmation”), in each case without incurring a charge. However, if you cancel more than after 5 minutes after Confirmation, that will be treated as a “no-show”, which will be recorded on your profile, and a cancellation charge will be payable.

11.4. If a Driver is more than 20 minutes late, you can cancel your booking without a no-show being recorded or incurring any charges.

11.5. If a Driver has to wait for more than 10 minutes after his arrival at the specified pickup location, he may cancel the booking request; in this case a no-show will be recorded on your profile and a cancellation charge will be payable. If the Driver does not cancel the booking request after 10 minutes, he may charge a waiting charge per minute or part thereof, at the rate specified on the Platform, which shall be in addition to any applicable cancellation or no-show charge in the event of a no show or cancellation after a Driver has waited for you. We will keep track of the average time that a Driver must wait for you after he has arrived at the pickup location (or after the booking time if later).

11.6. Third-Party Driver Companies can filter out future booking requests of passengers with a high no-show percentage and/or high average delay or may decide to charge more than they otherwise would.

11.7. After you have completed a trip booked through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and provide additional feedback about the Services as well as the Driver.

11.8. You can pay for your trip in cash, by card, Apple Pay or Google Pay though our App. The card details you are asked to submit will be provided directly to our payment provider via secure connection. You may save your card details in the App, but these are held by One Car Rental’s third-party payment providers rather than One Car Rental itself. The cardholder must retain a copy of the relevant transaction records. We accept payments online in AED using Visa, MasterCard credit/debit cards and AMEX. After you have paid for a trip, you may be sent a payment receipt on behalf of a Third–Party Driver Company by email (which is not equivalent to a tax invoice). Tax invoices are available through the Platform on request.

11.9. By accepting these Terms, each Client authorizes One Car Rental to charge them automatically for any Charges, without the need for any additional notice or consent. The Clients are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and payment card information to One Car Rental and for notifying One Car Rental of any changes to such information.
